The word “vote” means to choose from a list, to elect or to determine.
The main goal of voting (in a scenario involving the citizens of a
given country) is to come up with leaders of the people‟s choice.
Most countries, Kenya not an exception have problems when it comes
to voting. Some of the problems involved include ridging votes during
election, insecure or inaccessible polling stations, inadequate polling
materials and also inexperienced personnel.
This online voting/polling system seeks to address the above issues. It
should be noted that with this system in place, the users, citizens in
this case shall be given ample time during the voting period. They
shall also be trained on how to vote online before the election time
